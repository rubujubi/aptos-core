You are a security analyst reviewing a change to Movement's fork of aptos-core (m1 branch).

## Change Summary

{PACKET_SUMMARY}

## Subsystems Affected

{SUBSYSTEMS}

## Diff

{DIFF_HUNKS}

## Context

{CONTEXT}

## Your Task

Analyze this change for security issues across ALL applicable categories:

### 1. Contract Execution Safety
- Does this change alter how Move bytecode is interpreted or verified?
- Can it cause a previously-safe contract to behave differently?
- Can it allow a previously-rejected contract to deploy or execute?

### 2. Transaction Integrity
- Does this change affect which transactions are accepted or rejected?
- Can it bypass authentication, sequence number, or gas checks?
- Does it change prologue/epilogue behavior?

### 3. State Integrity
- Can this change cause state corruption, lost writes, or phantom reads?
- Does it affect Merkle proof generation or verification?
- Can it cause inconsistency between state views?

### 4. Consensus Safety
- Can this change cause validators to disagree on block validity?
- Does it affect liveness, finality guarantees, or epoch transitions?
- Can it enable equivocation or stalling?

### 5. Cryptographic Correctness
- Does this change use cryptographic primitives correctly?
- Are signature verification, hashing, or randomness generation affected?
- Can it weaken authentication or introduce malleability?

### 6. Gas and Economic Safety
- Can this change allow undercharging (DoS via cheap compute)?
- Can it cause overcharging (griefing via inflated costs)?
- Does it change fee distribution or economic incentives?

### 7. Denial of Service
- Can this change be exploited to exhaust memory, CPU, or storage?
- Does it introduce unbounded loops, uncapped allocations, or amplification?
- Can it cause node crashes or network-level disruption?

### 8. Movement-Specific Risks
- Does this change interact with Movement's DA layer, settlement, or custom wrappers?
- If this differs from upstream Aptos, is the deviation intentional and safe?
- Does it assume upstream behavior that Movement has modified?

## Analysis Rules

- Only report issues you can trace to specific code in the diff or context. No speculation.
- Only emit `## Finding:` when you can prove a complete activation chain:
  build/config preconditions -> runtime reachability -> attacker or operator trigger -> concrete impact.
- If any link in the activation chain is missing, do NOT emit `## Finding:`.
- If the issue depends on a non-default build feature, disabled-by-default runtime config, operator self-sabotage, or explicit sanitizer bypass, emit `## Deployment Footgun:` instead of `## Finding:`.
- If the code looks suspicious but you cannot prove runtime reachability or impact, emit `## Hypothesis:` instead of `## Finding:`.
- For feature-gated, build-gated, or config-gated paths, you must identify:
  1. where the path is enabled,
  2. whether it is enabled by default,
  3. what deployment role can enable it,
  4. what guards or sanitizers block it in supported environments.
- For each finding, cite the exact file:line and explain the attack path.
- Consider both direct effects and indirect effects via callers/callees.
- If the change is a fix, check whether the fix is complete (all code paths covered).
- If the change is a feature, check whether it introduces new attack surface.
- Rate each finding: critical / high / medium / low / info.
- Rate your confidence: 0.0 - 1.0 with a brief justification.
- Severity caps:
  - build-time or test-only path: at most `low`
  - non-default operator config only: at most `medium`
  - disabled-by-default feature with no supported production enablement: `info` or `Deployment Footgun`
- Quantify conditional impact precisely. Do not overstate the blast radius if only a subset of cases is affected.

## Output Format

Use one of the following block types:

1. `## Finding:` for live, reachable vulnerabilities or regressions.
2. `## Deployment Footgun:` for dangerous code paths that require non-default build/config/operator enablement.
3. `## Hypothesis:` for suspicious patterns that need more proof and must NOT be counted as findings.

For each `## Finding:`:

```
## Finding: {title}

**Severity**: critical / high / medium / low / info
**Confidence**: {0.0 - 1.0} — {why}
**Category**: {which of the 8 categories above}
**Location**: {file}:{line_start}-{line_end}
**Description**: {what is wrong}
**Attack Path**: {step by step how this can be exploited or cause harm}
**Impact**: {what happens if unaddressed — be specific}

**Fix Options**:
| Option | Effort | Tradeoff | Code Change? |
|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| {option A} | none/low/medium/high | {what you accept} | yes/no |
| {option B} | ... | ... | ... |

**Recommended Fix**: {which option and why}
**Fix Details**: {specific implementation guidance — where to change, what to change}
```

ALL fields above are mandatory for every `## Finding:`. If a finding has only one fix path, still list it as a single-row table.

For each `## Deployment Footgun:` use:

```
## Deployment Footgun: {title}

**Severity Ceiling**: low / medium
**Confidence**: {0.0 - 1.0} — {why}
**Location**: {file}:{line_start}-{line_end}
**Activation Chain**: {which step depends on non-default build/config/operator action}
**Why Not A Live Finding**: {what prevents this from being a supported-production vulnerability today}
**Operational Risk**: {what goes wrong if someone ships/enables it anyway}
**Recommended Guardrail**: {CI gate, startup assertion, config sanitizer, docs, etc.}
```

For each `## Hypothesis:` use:

```
## Hypothesis: {title}

**Confidence**: {0.0 - 1.0} — {why this is incomplete}
**Location**: {file}:{line_start}-{line_end}
**Missing Proof**: {which activation-chain or impact link you could not prove}
**Needed Verification**: {what code trace, runtime test, or config check is still required}
```

If no issues found, state that explicitly with your reasoning for why the change is safe.
